# UNHCR
I am analyzing data from UNHCR to understand the flows of asylum seekers and refugees from country to country. You can download the raw dataset I started with on this repository ( the file is "new_ref_arrival_new_asy_app_1962_2019.xlsx").

An interactive HTML output of my code is available here

I have also uploaded the R Markdown file used to create this HTML file to this repository.
